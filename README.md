# Nodemailer Bulk Email Validator

This repository contains a tool for validating bulk email addresses using Nodemailer. It allows you to verify the validity of multiple email addresses before sending out bulk emails, ensuring higher delivery rates and cleaner mailing lists.

## Features

- **Bulk Email Validation**: Validate a large list of email addresses in a single operation.
- **Nodemailer Integration**: Leverages Nodemailer for easy setup and configuration.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handles email validation asynchronously for faster processing.
- **Detailed Validation Reports**: Provides comprehensive reports on valid, invalid, and undeliverable email addresses.
- **Customizable Validation Rules**: Easily configure the validation rules to meet specific needs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vamseedhar-fullstack/nodemailer-bulk-email-validator.git
   cd nodemailer-bulk-email-validator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your Nodemailer settings:
   ```env
   SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
   SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
   SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the validation process with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Email List**:
   - Add the email addresses you want to validate to the `emails.txt` file, each on a new line.

2. **Run the Validator**:
   - Execute the script to start the validation process. The application will check each email address for validity and deliverability.

3. **Review Validation Results**:
   - After validation, review the results in the output file, which will categorize emails into valid, invalid, and undeliverable.

## Customization

- **Validation Rules**: Modify the validation logic in the `validator.js` file to fit your specific requirements.
- **SMTP Configuration**: Adjust the SMTP settings in the `.env` file to use your preferred email service provider.
